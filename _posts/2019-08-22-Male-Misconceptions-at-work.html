      <h3>Working with All Males</h3>

          I work in downtown Provo at a tech startup in an international office. We have teams all across the world working together to
            build products. It’s pretty awesome. In our Provo office, there are just 10 of us. A small team, with venture backing, nine 
            20-something males and me. I am the only female on the Provo team, and surprisingly, I am the only engineer too. I help manage 
            software on this side of the ocean. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my third gig at a tech startup as the only women on the team. In each place I have worked there are some male oversights
            that happen in the work place, I'd like to bring to your attention. Maybe start a dialogue on how to make sure both women and men feel
            safe in the workplace.
      </p>

          I first want to say that I love where I work. They are so good to me, and very supportive of my goals, ambitions, and dreams. 
          When I got married, the team drove 3 hours to attend my wedding reception. My birthday and life accomplishments are never 
          forgotten, and working here is fun.

          I am in no way complaining about where I work, but there are a few male oversights that I want to address. These conversations 
          need to be had in a constructive and positive environment. Gender diversity is very needed in any company, and that some basic 
          female requirements are overlooked, especially since the majority of managers and C-suite executives are still male.

        <p>
          I know, I know.. I’m going to address the uncomfortable. We all already know that men often leave the toilet seat up, but in addition to that complaint, I want to bring awareness to another situation. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Every week we all have cleaning assignments. Everyone except me that is. I came in the week that cleaning assignments were assigned. To avoid scaring me away, they didn’t give me anything to be responsible for, and I never asked. Atleast I wasn’t assumed to do the cleaning since I am female… Progress is being made!
        </p>
        <p>
          Long story short, the office is pretty clean. Even the microwave and fridge in the shared space is cleaned regularly. Besides the kitchen, we also have 2 bathrooms in the office, each with its own toilet, sink, paper towel dispenser, and garbage can. It is taken care of by men though, and the oversight is obvious. There is no garbage liner in the garbage can… ever. The paper towels thrown away are just picked up by hand and tossed into a large garbage sack once a week. I don’t think any of these men ever thought that something would need to be thrown away in the bathroom other than the paper towels. None of the dudes have ever had periods.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know what you must be thinking. “Come on, a garbage can that isn’t lined isn’t a big deal”. But it kind of is a big deal. During my time of the month, where am I supposed to put my feminine products. The options are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
              Wrap everything up in toilet paper and put it in the non-lined garbage can and hope nothing seeps through or that the dude emptying the garbage doesn’t touch anything
          </li>
          <li>
              Finish my business in the bathroom, carry the feminine product out of the bathroom, down the hall, into the kitchen where there is the closest lined garbage can and throw it away there (then go back to the bathroom to wash my hands). 
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Feminine products are gross, and should be disposed of. Touching a used feminine product is not what anyone wants. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I would have never thought to not line a garbage can with liners, and I guess males just don’t think to line them.

            For a while, the default password used in the office was “BuffChick”. Yes, that was really it. Keep in mind that this password was created and shared among the 9 other guys in the office before I was hired. It was probably was the cause of quite a few jokes and laughs. This is the heart of the #broCulture at work. Like of all the funny phrases that you could use to be a password, you pick something that is targeted and demeaning towards women? I know, it’s a small thing, but the little things add up, and soon you have only 1 female in your office of 10 people… oh wait…

          <h3>Subtle Slut Shaming</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

        <p>
          This is a hard topic to talk about, especially because I know my bosses (Hi Boss) sometimes read my blog posts. But I want to make sure this is addressed… so here goes:
        </p>
        <p>
          At my work, there is no dress code. There doesn’t need to be, we all just wear what we are comfortable in… literally. Some people where sweats, and there are a surprisingly amount of Lulu lemon pants in the office. My work attire consists of t-shirts, shorts, and sneakers.  
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, I was talking with 4 other guys in the office, and we were talking about Comicon. How great it would be to go, how expensive it is, and how outrageous the costumes are. I mentioned that I don’t even know what half the costumes are, they people just wear random things to look like a character. Someone took that statement, and extended that women just “dress slutty and look like porn”.  Yes, that was really said. I’m sure if I wasn’t there to point out that saying something like that is completely inappropriate, others would have agreed with him, and just laughed about it together. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I get it, at Comicon, there are plenty of people, male and women that wear more revealing clothing. Some even just wearing body paint. But that doesn’t mean they deserve to be slut shamed… or even worse compared to porn. I pointed out that you can never compare a women to porn, even if she is naked. A women’s body, especially doing something as fun and innocent like dressing up for a convention, is NOT porn. A women should never be compared to porn.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I won’t go into the details about how comparing women to a sexualized object and fantasy, can definitely make someone feel uncomfortable in the work place, and affects their work. Those stories and research are shared elsewhere. I am just here to share my experience. After that conversation, I did become a lot more conscious about what I was wearing, and no longer followed the rule of “just wear what makes you comfortable” like by male counterparts get to follow. I avoided shorts, and always covered my shoulders, even I am comfortable in both tank tops and shorts.

            <h3>Providing Solutions</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I want to be clear, I am not blaming male colleagues for the gender gap in the workplace. I think we are passed the point of blame, and should be focusing our efforts on solutions. The three situations explained above are just a few examples of male oversight I have experienced. One event alone wouldn’t change a career position. It’s the continual male oversights that occurs which makes it uncomfortable for women. \ while males are still the majority of managers, they need to be extra conscious of their oversights, that could drive away female talent. When you are comfortable at work, you are more able to perform your job to the best of your abilities, and everyone succeeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am personally so grateful that I have never been in a terrible interview, where my interviewer was asking inappropriate questions like those in the recent Wired article published on the GirlsWhoCode research project. My work is so understanding about the issues I bring up. And although we as a society still have a long ways from riding the work place of all false female stereotypes and providing a more comfortable environment for both males and females to thrive in the workspace, many companies are coming a long way in over-coming these oversights and issues.
