        Hi! Welcome to the about me page of my website!
      </p>
      <h5>Website Background</h5>
      <p>
        while you are here, I want to share a little bit about this blog, and why I write it:
      </p>
      <p>
        I have this website is to experiment with front end design and web development ideas and practices. This entire website is written public on github. I am currently exploring Bootstrap.
        The other reason I write is to become a better writter. I am a Computer Engineer. Explaining things in a way computers can understand is easy for me. Explaining things so that humans can understand is difficult 
      </p>
      <p>
        I make the source code and all blog posts public so that it forces me to acknowledge my audience. To not take short cuts, or let a typo slip through.
      </p>
      <p>
        So thank you for being here. Thank you for keeping me accountable to struggle, learn, and grow!

        Finding an identity and introducing yourself to an online community is something most people never saw coming. But here we are in the day and age where
        we all have <i>Personal Brands</i> and <i>online reputations</i> that can matter more than a real life reputation. Where you can learn any skill to become who you want to be from behind a screen.

        Well here is my online introduction. I am JoCee Porter Holladay, a computer Engineer who graduated from the University of Utah. I have dabbled in other fields from
        business (I founded a nonprofit at 19 that served hundreds of girls a year), Venture Capital (I was <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jocee-porter">Managing Partner for Campus Founders Fund</a>), Nuclear Research and software development (Won a few national and International awards for research on Neutron Activation Anaylsis), 
        to Finance (I did multiple internships on Wall Street in NYC and in Conneticut)
      </p>
      <p>
        I have currently settled into the roll of Technical Director of <a href="www.crispnow.com">Crisp</a>. I recently got married to another Computer Scientist, and we spend out 
        time together building projects, and learning new technical skills. Most recently, we built a web app together for his startup <a href="www.listant.com">ListValet</a>.
