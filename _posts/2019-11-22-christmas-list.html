    <p>
      Christmas is coming up. Which means, crucnch time for those :gift: ... If you've like me, you've 
      been looking at Christmas gift guides online. You might have been disapointed in the gift
      guides for pre-teen girls. The lists aren't nearly as cool and fun as the gift guide for boys.
      The recommended toys for girls are basically just fluff, cutsey makeup, decor, and dolls. 
      While the boys lists are full of tech, science, and math. This got me a little sad. 
      So... I made a gift guide for girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      5 Qualities gifts that are feminine, fun, and tech focused. A short and sweet list, with quality ideas, not just a long list
      of mediocre presents.

      <p>
        This book will inspire your girl. A book about a normal girl going through the average middle school struggles
        (friends, drama, teachers, rumors, school, boys). This normal girl develops the skills to build a fashion app.
        This app becomes super popular and changes her
        life. Let your girl realize that she can be anything... anyone. Readers, and non-readers alike will be hooked on this story, and inspired
        to create something.

      <p>
        A Math interactive boardgame? Umm yes! Your daughter can practice her multiplication in a fun interactive way 
        (not from those flash cards which we used as a kid) with you, siblings, or friends. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/03/both-genders-think-women-are-bad-basic-math">The majority of women feel like they
        aren't good at math, and that men are better at math.</a> Let's fight this (obviously) untrue opinion, and promote math in our daughters lives. 
        A fun way to do this is with a game.. a board game, play with her, and remind her that she is good at math, and that math skill has nothing
        to do with gender.

      <p>
        But.... if you must be traditional and get a traditional girls toy, alteast pick up Robotic Engineer Barbie.
      </p>
      <p>
          Barbie may have a controversial past, from the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-barbies-sidebar-20180309-story.html">â€œmath class is tough" </a> days, but I think it might be time to give them a fresh start. 
          They are pushing the narrative that girls can be anything, by creating engineering career barbies. They also created an entire section on 
          Robotic Engineering through their Barbie You Can Be Anything programming experience on their website.

        That is my list of 5 items to get your girls. Give more than just toys this season... Let every girl know that they
        are smart and capable. That they can be anything.... an engineer, artist, scientist, mom, or anything. Whatever
        they choose!
