        Hi! Welcome to the about me page of my website!
      </p>
      <h4>Website Background</h4>
      <p>
        While you are here, I want to share a little bit about this blog, and why I write it:
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is a place for me to experiment with front end design and web development. New ideas, designs, and best practices. This entire website is public on github, and my contribution to the open source community.
        The other reason I write is to become a better writter. I am a Computer Engineer. Explaining things in a way computers can understand is easy for me. On the other hand, explaining things so that humans can understand is very difficult for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I make the source code and all blog posts public to force me to acknowledge my audience. I can not take short cuts, or let a typo slip through.
      </p>
      <p>
        So thank you for being here. Thank you for keeping me accountable to struggle, learn, and grow!

    we all have <i>Personal Brands</i> and <i>online reputations</i> that can matter more than a real life reputation. Where you can learn any skill and become who you want behind a screen.

  <p>
    So, here goes --
