title: Why I started a Day Planner Company
description: During the global pandemic, my life was so messed up. The boundary between work, school, free time and side hustle totally blurred. I needed a dayplanner! I couldn't find anything online that had a layout I needed for my brain... so I created one, and built a tool so you can too!
