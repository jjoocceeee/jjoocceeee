        <h2>What I bought because of Instagram "Influencers"</h2>
        <p>
          I hate being bored. That is probably just my Generation Z attitude talking, but I really hate it. There are many times throughout the day, where there is a short amount of time that isn’t accounted for. You must know, those times where it is too short to start doing anything productive, but too long to sit there and stare at the wall. The 15 minutes between classes, 5 minutes waiting for the train, 6 minutes standing in line for lunch, 10 minutes waiting for my husband to finish his hair, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, during these intermittent breaks, I pull out my phone and open up Instagram. I’m never on Instagram for long, but the total time spent on the app quickly adds up. Instagram reports that I spend on average 1 hour and 48 minutes on their app each day!
        </p>
        <p>
          I wouldn’t consider myself an Instagram super user, I hardly ever post on my own feed, I don’t take pretty enough pictures for that. I do find myself consuming content on Instagram like crazy though. Double tapping and swipping through stories is so natural. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Many companies are using Instagram to jump start their business or advertise. One of the major issues with this kind of marketing (and marketing in general) whether or not the money spent on influencer and Instagram marketing is worth it, and produces a purchase or atleast a bit more brand awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
          To answer these questions for myself, I did an experiment and for a few weeks, I recorded the content that influencers (and normies) post that make me either shop around, or buy.
        </p>
        <h4>Influence Experient</h4>
        <p>
          For each post that triggered my attention and made me consider checking out a product, I recorded the steps that I took, what caught my attention, and if I made a purchase, how much I spent. All because I was “influenced” to do so on Instagram.

          I saw this amazing piece of art on @emilyijackson ‘s feed. I instantly fell in love and wanted on of my husband and I with New York city in the background. The artwork was done by @jenlublindesign, so I followed her and spent a good 30 minutes checking out her page.

            I love photos, especially for fun occasions. A few weeks ago, I got married, but before I got married, I saw this post on a popular Wedding Inspiration feed @NewYorkBridesMag. I followed the photographer, and spent quite a while going through her feed. Although I loved her style, she is based in Russia, which will not lead to a sale for this photographer by being featured. It did lead to a sale for a local photographer, who I asked to replicate this kind of shoot!

        <p>Three weeks after my fiancé and I got married, I flew out to New York City to live for the summer, while he stays home in Utah. During one of his visits out to New York, 
          I wanted to get images of us taken to remember our summers of long distance. I went looking for New York photographers. I went to the pages of some NYC 
          influencers I follow, and searched for the photographers who took some of their pictures I liked. I saw this image of @Catherinepdv 
          and followed her tag to the photographer @someShellyPhotography.

            It was so nice to quickly see where Shelly was located… In NYC! Perfect! I messaged her, and we set up a  photoshoot for my husband and I.

            <li>Followed favorite photographers</li>
            <li>Bought a photoshoot from Shelly ($200+ purchase))</li>
            <li>Now we are friends, and we comment on each others posts. I also recommend her all the time!</li>

            Here is one of the amazing pictures that she took for us… I am super happy with this purchase, and that we found her.

            Steps Taken:

            <li>Went to Kylie’s 21 buttons site to see how much this dress was</li>
            <li>Shopped around on her 21 buttons site for twenty minutes</li>
            <li>Decided the shoulders weren’t my thing and didn’t purchase. Didn't purchase anything at all from her 21 Buttons account. It is hard for me to purchase clothing online when the only images is of models... Since I am not a model size, I like to see regular people wearing the clothes before buying!</li>

          <h3>Experiment Findings</h3>
          <p>
              Instagram is a great way to reach your audience and to convert likes into sales. But from a consumer’s point of view, giveaways and sponsored posts aren’t the best way to get sales. 
          </p>
          <h5>What I learned from  this experiment:</h5>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>I am significantly more likely to purchase something if it is through a collaboration. </li>
            </ul>
            If someone who I follow, posts about a collaboration (and not an ad), I take the time to really look at the other vendors involved. This is opposite to sponsored posts, where I do not take the time to look into what is being sold. When things are organic and natural, I am more interested.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Content is King</li>
            </ul>
            If someone who I follow, posts about a collaboration (and not an ad), I take the time to really look at the other vendors involved. This is opposite to sponsored posts, where I do not take the time to look into what is being sold. When things are organic and natural, I am more interested.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>I am “influenced” to make purchases, but only on larger, exciting, and expensive items</li>
            </ul>
            Instagram got it right, I am definitely a follower. I am “influenced” by the people I follow.. but not nearly as much as you might think. I was NOT interested enough to purchase the small or common things that influencers might post about – necklaces, clothing, nair polish, etc. 
            What I did spend a lot of time and money on, were the larger and exciting things! On average, if I made a purchase through Instagram, it was for something more than $75.

              I will continue keeping track of what I buy on social media, and keep you updated every few months. I would love to know what you have bought because of an Instagram post, so let me know!
