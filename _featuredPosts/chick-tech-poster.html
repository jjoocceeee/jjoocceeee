description: There isn't much feminine technology accessories out there. If you are like me and hate the color green, then you are especially limited (seriously, why is everything green background with black text?!?!). So I decided to create my own computer science inspired poster.
subtitle: Steminist Poster
background: '/downloads/feminine_cs_poster.png'

            <h1>Free Downloadable Feminine Computer Science Poster</h1>
            <p>
                This poster was inspired by the many strong female leaders in technology who are paving the way for me and others. The women
                breaking the glass ceilings and who proudly say <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ilooklikeanengineer?lang=en">#ILookLikeAnEngineer</a>. 
                The people fighting to make technology a safe and inclusive place for everyone, women included.
                I hope this will hang proudly on your office wall, or even as decoration in your daughters room.
                Let every girl know that she is smart enough, and capable of being whatever she wants to be, including a computer scientist. And that she is 
                not alone. Technology is a place for women too.
