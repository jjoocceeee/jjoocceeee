            <h3>My Teaching Background</h3>
            <p>
                My senior year of highschool, I opted to do an internship instead of taking classes. My internship was teaching 2nd grade. So instead
                of going to my highschool everyday, I instead went to an elementary school and taught a classroom of twenty-five 8 year olds. I. LOVED. IT. 
                After the internship, I continued to be a substitute and guest teacher. In fact, I paid my way through my computer Engineering University degree by substitute teaching twice a week. I still substitute teach about twice a month. 
                Whenever I get invited into a classroom I try to incorporate a small Tech/Computer lesson into the day.

                Code is the language of the future. Even if you aren't interested in pursuing a career in computer programming, understanding how computers work is crucial to success.
                Technology will just continue to be more integrated into our lives and is becoming increasingly more important to understand.

                I want to make sure all students get some coding and technology exposure. You'd be surprised how young children can pick up on how computers work. We shouldn't be 
                saving this curiculum for highschool and college. We can teach teh basics of computers to students as young as 8. Trust me, I did it for a year!

                My goal is to write a computer science curriculum for elementary aged children. I would called it Elementary Engineered. Until I have accomplished that, I want you to have all of the 
                resources I have created. Let's integrate code and technology understanding into the lives of all children
