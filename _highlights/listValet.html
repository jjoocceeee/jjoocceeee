      <a href="http://listvalet.com">ListValet</a> is a new startup which connects people who are good at selling things
      online, to people who have items to sell. Following that Uber Model, except for online sellers. When I was first
      introduced to the company, not only did I just fall in love with the founders and the idea, I knew it would be the
      perfect opportunity to learn from a small team and get to be involved in every part of such a large and complex
      technology infrastructure! The team was just about to begin rebuilding the entire portfolio from scratch, so I
      jumped on, and was involved with it all.

      Willing to work hard and learn, the team let me be involved in all aspects of web platform. I was able to design
      database schemas, contribute to the GraphQL API, and brought to life the front-end.

      My main tasks included adding functionality and implementing designs for the front end, and adding GraphQL
      resolvers to the API. I spent my time 70% on the front end, and 20% on the backend, and 10% on Infrastructure. I
      built about 75% of the frontend user interface.

      <h3>React.js</h3>
      <p>Having never worked with React before, I had to go up a huge learning curve to begin contributing. I am now in
        love with React. React solves so many problems that front-end developers
        face. Creating reusable components, and compartmentalizing code, allows front-end development ability to create
        things much faster, and more efficiently. Being able to add state to a component,
        allows for more complex components to be built with React.

      <p>The backend contained many states and edges cases, as it was building a 2 sided marketplace, with a payment
        system. Below is a section of the database visualization that connects all the moving components for the backend
