    <h5> Background</h5>
    <p>
        For my senior project, I was able to convince 3 other of my classmates
        about the greatness of investing and Wall Street. We created a machine learning
        trading algorithm, which we implemented on a FPGA Board, to implement live trades on a paper portfolio.

    <h5> Overview</h5>
    <p>Our Trading algorithm takes different well known investing strategies to decide on a Buy or Sell in our stock universe,
        and uses machine learning to adjust the weights for each of these strategies for each stock in the universe.</p>
    <p>For example, a stock like Tesla might be more correlated with the general opinion of Twitter and Reddit users, while
        a stock like HealthEquity might be more correlated with the Four Candle Hammer Strategy.

    <h5> My Role</h5>
<p>
  My role in the project was creating the server and database. What a perfect opporunity to explore and learn graphql. GraphQl is a new(ish) technology invested by Facebook, and made public in 2012.
  GraphQL is a layer that sits on top of a restul server which directly calls and reaches out to the database, and simplifies how a server is written. It solves sooooo many problems.
  Specifically, I used graphql-compose and graphql-compose-mongoose to make development with my mongoDB super simple and smooth.
