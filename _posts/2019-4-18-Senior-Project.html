        For my senior project, I was able to convince 3 other of my classmates
        about the greatness of investing and Wall Street. We created a machine learning
        trading algorithm, which we implemented on a FPGA Board, to implement live trades on a paper portfolio.

    <img class="basic-image" src="/jjoocceeee/assets/Images/seniorProject.jpg" alt="Trading Algorithm Website">
    <p>Our Trading algorithm takes different well known investing strategies to decide on a Buy or Sell in our stock universe,
        and uses machine learning to adjust the weights for each of these strategies for each stock in the universe.</p>
    <p>For example, a stock like Tesla might be more correlated with the general opinion of Twitter and Reddit users, while
        a stock like HealthEquity might be more correlated with the Four Candle Hammer Strategy.

    <p>To learn more about the trading algorithms we are researching, feel free to checkout our <a href="https://jjoocceeee.github.io/trading_frontend/#/trading_frontend/"> Website</a> 
        which shows how our algorirthm is doing, recent trades, and our trading strategies

        Our technology stack includes
        <ul>
            <li>React - Frontend</li>
            <li>Ruby - API Server</li>
            <li>Python - Proxy between custom hardware and API</li>
            <li>Verilog - FPGA Implementation</li>
