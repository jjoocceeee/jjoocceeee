                Creating your own VSCode color theme is actually pretty simple. Like wayyyyy simple. A Visual Studio
                Code Color theme is just a
                set of JSON key-value pairs. The key is the type of object, and the value is the color of that object.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the process is very simple, there are many, many, many key value pairs to assign. To make
                things even more complicated, there are different theme sources for different languages. So your theme
                may look great in Python, but looks awful in C#, or Markdown, or javaScript, or whatever.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created a boiler plate that seperates the keys value pairs into language sections. I also added
                comments to help you understand what key the value is changing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just fork the repository, and you are off to the races!
